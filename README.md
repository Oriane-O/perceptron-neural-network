# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

This repository contains a simple implementation of the perceptron, one of the earliest models of artificial neural networks.  
The project demonstrates how a perceptron can learn linearly separable logical functions such as AND and OR, while also illustrating why it fails on the XOR problem.

## Features
- Implementation of a single-layer perceptron in Python 
- Training on logical functions (AND, OR)  
- Visualization of the decision boundary  
- Explanation of why XOR is not linearly separable
